Welcome, every one!
I just build an end to end text classification project using BERT/distilBert to classify cutomers' sentiments.
## Happy Coding all :smile:




# Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to analyze the the customer feedback from social media surveys, support tickets, or customer executive chats to determine the overall sentiment towards a company's products and services. The sentiment will classify into three catagories.



## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates **Text Classification using BERT**, a state-of-the-art transformer model from Hugging Face. It is designed as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** with a focus on modularity, scalability, and ease of integration into existing systems. The project is structured into **three pipelines**:
1. **Feature Engineering**
2. **Model Training**
3. **Inference Pipeline**
